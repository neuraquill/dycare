Project Wireframe: [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/TSFIzrygyKv70w03ldI4vg/Wire-frame-for-appointment-booking-app-(Community)-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=0AEdnBjAVzdbQkqM-1)

## UI/UX To-Do: Main

- [ ] Overall Design
- [ ] Multi OS Support, Responsive
- [ ] Google Maps Embed (Figure out the design, and what features to embed)
- [ ] Calender UI for appointments
- [ ] Back/Home button
- [ ] Call feature (upon clicking, should invoke a call)
- [ ] Payment gateway

## UI/UX To-Do: Secondary

- [ ] Make button animations
- [ ] Smoother screen changes
- [ ] Loading animations
- [ ] Adjustable settings (where font size can be changed, since elderly people need bigger fonts, and easy-on-the-eye colors)
- [ ] Multiple languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, ...) 


*Make changes/improvements to this list as seem fit, and whenever a task is completed, check it. First push to an indivisual branch, make sure it's working and pull the changes (only pull if the changes are in the main list. Anything from the secondary list would be added in the end).*
